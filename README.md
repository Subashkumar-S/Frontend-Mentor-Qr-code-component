## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From building this project I have learned some CSS properties like box-shadow and it's values. I have come up with various layout options like grid, flexbox, box and finally uses flexbox to body and container.

It helps me recall git commands and how to host a static page using github.

```css
body{
    width: 100%;
    min-height: 100vh;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
    justify-items: center;
}
.container{
    width: 21.5rem;
    max-height: fit-content;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    text-align: center;
    justify-content: space-around;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius: 25px;
    box-shadow: .5rem .5rem .5rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.11);
}
```


### Continued development

To practice more CSS layout and check how they work helps me continue focusing on in future projects.
